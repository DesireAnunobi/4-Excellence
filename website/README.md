# 4-Excellence Front-End Website

This website acts as a front-end to the 4-Excellence application. It allows students to create accounts or login to existing accounts. They can use their account to play a collection of games and view their statistics in a personal profile. Students can delete their account at any time. It also allows teachers to login to existing accounts, which they can use to create classes and assign students to classes they own. They can then use these classes to monitor the results of their students
