# 4-Excellence Back-End Server & Database

This is the server of the 4-Excellence application. Individual schools can clone this server and run it in the cloud provider of their choice. The server consists of a RESTful API running on Node.js and built using Express.js. It also offers a database file that opens a connection to a Supabase-hosted database. Individual schools will need to create a Supabase database of their own in order to run the database.
